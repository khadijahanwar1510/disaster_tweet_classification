**Neural network based multiclass classifier of disaster tweets
I built a multiclass classification model for natural disaster tweets using the HumAID dataset containing ~77K tweets to predict what aspect of the disaster each tweet addresses (e.g. warnings, advice, prayers). I used feature extraction using TFIDF and Glove embedding methods, and I compared traditonal methods (support vector machines, naive bases classifiers, and random forest classifiers) with neural networks (Long Short-Term Memory architectures). The two champion models identified were an SVC classifier and a BiLSTM model. Two notable differences between the models are that SVC, although prone to overfitting, does a better job of correctly classifying tweets that arenâ€™t humanitarian at all, perhaps due to a clear decision boundary, whereas the BiLSTM model sometimes confuses non-humanitarian and damage tweets - perhaps as many non-humanitarian tweets include words about damage. On the other hand, the BiLSTM model correctly identifies caution tweets more often, but it also seems more likely to over-predict caution tweets as tweets in other categories are more frequently misclassified as caution tweets than by the SVC model.
